======

This generates a hierarchical POMDP based on a set of questions and their affect on some discrete belief state.  

- See DialogModel.py for documentation on usage.
- See GenerateInput.py for a usage (not complete yet).
- See Examples/TestQuestions.json for an example input schema.

(Currently in progress)
This takes noisy input, i.e. from an EEG, and feeds it into the POMDP to determine the next step.
